        Speech recognition is a technology which recently has been getting an increasing amount of attention on the consumer market.
        This project explores the potentials and
        limitations of using voice control for audible news consumption in the home. This is accomplished through a research through
        design approach, developing News Butler, a news application prototype for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E">Amazon Echo</a>,
        in collaboration with a major media group in the United Kingdom called <a href="http://www.archant.co.uk/">Archant Media Group</a>. <br /><br />

        We chose to work with the Amazon Echo as it is (at the time of writing, Feb 2016) the most commercially available product capable of the functionality
        needed in the prototype. The prototype was designed and developed in an iterative design process including workshops with international research
        partners and testing with clients and stakeholders in the usergroups of these partners. <br /><br />

        As the project is a thesis project, much of the attention has been on the academic side with an extensive litterature review and analysis/condensation,
        and also documentation of the project in its entirity manifested in the thesis.
