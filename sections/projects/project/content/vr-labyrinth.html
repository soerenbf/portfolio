        This project was done to conduct experiments on the coorporation and teamworking capabilities of people in different roles.
        The game is a 2-player
        time trial labyrinth game, in which two players coorporate to get all the way through the labyrinth as fast as possible. <br /><br />

        The two players each play a unique role. One player plays the game as a ground level runner who is in control of running through the labyrinth.
        The other player plays the game through a role seeing the labyrinth from the top, limited by the camera distance to the running player as seen
        in the image. To help the players get through the labyrinth, the overview player is able to lift the running player from the ground whenever
        the running player reaches a dead end. As the running player gets to the end of the labyrinth, the timer stops. The controller of the overview
        player also allows him/her to control a giant hand, giving the ability to make gestures such as pointing, as seen in the image.<br /><br />

        To limit the view of the runner and to help the roles immerse themselves into their own role, the running role sees the game through a virtual
        reality headset (<a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us/rift/">Oculus Rift</a>), while the overview player sees the game through a regular screen,
        but has a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> controller available, to be able to lift the running player from the labyrinth.
