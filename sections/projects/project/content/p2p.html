        As an exam project in a course called Peer to peer networking, I made an experimental p2p network with the concept overlay of
        sharing poetry between peers, inspired by modern torrent networks. <br /><br />

        The project was coded in Java using the Remote procedure call (RPC) library and was divided into a series of steps and supported commands,
        each making the network functionality more complex and complete. The final project had the functionality making it capable of locating files
        over an unknown network and downloading them when they were found.<br /><br />

        Many different approaches could have been taking with regards to programming languages. My group and I chose Java, as we were all most
        comfortable with this.
