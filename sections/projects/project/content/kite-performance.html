        This project was done out of interest in the subject and sport of kitesurfing. It revolves around testing kitesurfing equipment, specifically
        the kites used for the sport as different models and shapes exist, which are used for different things. Although this is a well known
        fact, we found little research on the topic. <br /><br />

        The prototype consists of an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ arduinoBoardMega2560">Arduino Mega</a>, which recieves input from
        different sensors: 3 <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=3138">strain guages</a> to measure both pressure
        on the bar used to control the kite and the pull of the kite, an <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/ products/1733">anemometer</a> to
        measure the wind speed, and an <a href="http://playground. arduino.cc/Main/MPU-6050">gyroscope + accelerometer</a> to measure the angle
        of the kite. When combined and used synchronously, these form a rich data set which can be analysed to to form a set of characteristics
        for the kite. As this equipment was to be used outside, we embedded the equipment in plastic boxes to make it weatherproof. <br /><br />

        In our analysis of the data, we look at all the data combined and isolated into sets of 2 parameters to identify the performance of
        each kite in relation to the others tested.
