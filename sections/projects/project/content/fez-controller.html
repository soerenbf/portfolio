        This project was made in a university course called 3D prototyping. The course had the theme of game controllers made specifically for one game.
        My group and I chose the game, <a href="http://fezgame.com/" target="_blank">Fez</a>, which has the theme of a 2D character with the ability
        of moving on 3D space.<br /><br />

        The prototype is a 3D printed 3D model with a arduino nano inside of it which is served input from a bluetooth controller, paired to the pc
        running the game. In our controller, we focused on mapping the central components of the game onto the controller. It featured support for
        all the controls in the game, and added another dimension to the controller, as the player is able to manipulate the rotation of the in-game
        world by turning the cube in the centre of the controller.<br /><br />

        The design of the controller is inspired from arcade games and specifically the
        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/NES-controller.jpg" target="_blank">NES controller<a/>.
        The design of the cube originates from within
        the Fez game itself. The character in the game collects puzzle pieces, making up a cube reminiscent of the one in the controller when all put
        together.
