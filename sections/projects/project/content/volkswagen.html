      <p>
        In the spring of 2015 a project course "Innovation Project" led me to the exiting opportunity of doing a design project in coorporation
        with car manufacturer, <a href="http://en.volkswagen.com/en.html">Volkswagen</a>. It was a group project with a time-span of 7 weeks
        during which several prototypes were developed, both
        low fidelity and high(er) fidelity concluding with a presentation of the concept and prototype at the Volkswagen headquarters in
        Wolfsburg, Germany. <br /><br />

        During the course I took on the role for the entire class as project manager, leading to extra tasks such as communication through teaching
        staff with the contacts we had in Volkswagen.<br /><br />

        As the everyone who attended the course agreed to sign a non disclosure agreement, I cannot go into details with the specific prototypes
        developed, nor can I disclose the results.
