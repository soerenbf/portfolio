        The proximity based study network, making up my bachelor project, was a purely software prototype developed for iOS with the purpose
        of exploring another form of information sharing between university students. <br /><br />

        Students, and people for that matter, help each other with problems all the time but it might be hard to find help for a specific problem
        if you don't know the people in your immediate proximity. This was our main motivation for the project. Of course, theres the internet,
        which is very usable for finding solutions to problems, but we wanted to explore another approach as this could also be used to
        form new acquaintances. <br /><br />

        The project was conducted on a very conceptual basis with a prototype coded as a native iOS application, but with loads of functionality missing.
        Spanning over a 7 week period, not much development time is given besides the ideation and testing phases of the design process.
