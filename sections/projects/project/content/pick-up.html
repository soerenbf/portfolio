        Pick up to cheer up was a two man group project made in a course called Urban Intervention, with the purpose of designing an urban intervention
        with the theme of happiness. <br /><br />

        We wanted to explore the concept of talking to complete anonymous strangers and how we (as the strangers with whom they talked) could make
        people happy. The inspiration for this concept comes from Denmark being called happiest nation, while the experience of walking
        the streets of any city in Denmark is an experience filled with busy people who don't interact much. <br /><br />

        Our final intervention design was a phone, set in the middle of the street with a sign pointing towards it saying "Pick up
        to Cheer up!". To document the project and make the video, we had a GoPro camera hidden in the "i" of the sign. <br /><br />

        While being a very different design challenge, the project was very enjoyable, as we got to talk to some people and give them a different
        than usual experience of walking the streets of Aarhus.
