        This design project was done in a course called "Shape-changing interfaces", which had the focus of exploring design possibilities offered
        in shape-changing concepts. <br /><br />

        My group and I decided to explore the concept of spaciality, having one shape which divides into two seperate shapes. We made a lamp which
        opens opun a person moving in its immediate proximity (~1 meter), providing limited light to the inhabited space. The shape-change
        and light increase can communicate affordances like accessibility, which could be used in a number of interfaces. An example could be an
        anwering machine, reading out new messages. <br /><br />

        The prototype displayed in the video is the final of two developed prototypes in the course, which spanned over a 7 week period.
